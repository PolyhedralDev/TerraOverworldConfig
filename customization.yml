global-scale: 1
# Modifies the scale of all biome distribution, you can use this parameter 
# to if you want just about every biome to be larger or smaller.
# By doubling the scale, you double the length & width of everything,
# e.g. if you have a biome that is 300 blocks wide with a scale of 1, and
# increase that scale to 2, that biome will generate 600 blocks wide.

# Default: 0.05

# ---
# Elevation
# ---

elevation-scale: 1
# Controls the scale of the elevation noise map. A larger scale results in larger distances
# between aspects like mountain ranges and flat areas. If you want more gradual changes in
# elevation, you can increase this. Conversely, if you want more sudden changes in elevation,
# you can decrease this.
# Note - This does not affect how tall the terrain is in individual biomes, for that you
#        can check out the parameters under the 'Terrain' section.
# Default: 1

elevation-multiplier: 1
# Multiplier on the elevation value
# If set to 0, elevation will be the value set by 'elevation-offset' defined below
# Default: 1

elevation-offset: 0
# Adds / subtracts from the elevation value
# Default: 0

elevation-highlands-threshold: 0.4
# Default: 0.4

elevation-lowlands-threshold: 0.1
# Default: 0.1

elevation-factor-continental: 1
# Determines if terrain height will be reduced closer to coasts. This
# is used to prevent mountains forming right up against the ocean, and
# gradually smooths the terrain into coasts. The continental values at which
# terrain goes from 100% to flat can be customized with the options below.
# 1 = true, 0 = false
# Default: 1

elevation-continental-full-height-threshold: 0.2
# The continental value at which terrain height is 100%, only applicable if
# the terrain-factor-continental option is enabled
# Default: 0.2

elevation-continental-flat-threshold: -0.3
# The continental value at which terrain height will be flat, only applicable if
# the terrain-factor-continental option is enabled
# Default: -0.3

elevation-factor-rivers: 1
# Determines if terrain will gradually reduce closer to rivers.
# 1 = true, 0 = false
# Default: 1

elevation-factor-spawn-island: 1
# Determines if spawn island noise affects terrain, 1 = true, 0 = false
# Default: 1

elevation-spawn-island-scale: 0.3
# Scales elevation within the spawn island. E.g 0.3 means elevation is set to 30%
# within the spawn island.
# Default: 0.3

elevation-fuzz: 0.25
# Adds a slight bit of fuzziness to elevation, roughening terrain block countours
# and steep hills that look overly smooth. Small 1 block divots tend to be produced
# by this fuzzing. Recommended to be a small number between 0 and 0.5.
# Setting to 0 removes any fuzzing.
# Default: 0.25

flatness-blend: 0.35
# Default: TODO

# ---
# Temperature
# ---

temperature-scale: 1
# Controls the scale of temperature zones. Most biomes are placed according to
# a temperature map so hot biomes can't generate next to cold biomes, as well as
# allowing for biomes of similar temperatures to generate together. Increasing this
# will increase the distance between temperature changes, which results in things like
# hot and cold biomes generating further apart - and vice versa when decreasing it.
# Default: 1

temperature-offset: 0
# Offsets how hot / cold temperature is
# Default: 0

temperature-spread: 1
# How spread out the temperature difference is
# Default: 1

temperature-altitude-lapse-rate: 0.8
# How fast temperature drops with altitude
# Default: 1.3

temperature-altitude-lapse-start: 0.2
# The altitude temperature should begin to drop at
# Default: 0.2

# ---
# Precipitation
# ---

precipitation-scale: 1
# Controls the scale of precipitation zones. Same idea as temperature zones, where
# humid biomes generate away from arid biomes, and biomes of similar precipitation
# generate together.

precipitation-offset: 0
# Default 0

precipitation-spread: 1
# Default: 1

precipitation-ocean-threshold: -1
# Default -1

# ---
# Variation
# ---

variation-scale: 1
# Controls scale of biome variations within each climate zone.
# Decreasing this will result in more smaller biomes to generate in any given
# climate, while increasing it will result in larger climate variations.
# Default: 1

# ---
# Caves
# ---

cave-biome-scale: 1
# Controls the scale of the placement of cave biomes, larger scale = bigger areas of
# any given cave biome, smaller scale = smaller cave biomes.
# Default: 1

# ---
# Oceans
# ---

ocean-shallow-threshold: -0.15
# Elevation above this threshold is set to generate as shallow ocean. Lower number = larger area of shallow ocean
# and vice versa.
# Default: -0.1

ocean-deep-threshold: -0.8
# Elevation at which deep oceans are placed. Higher number = larger area of deep ocean
# and vice versa.
# Default: -0.8

# ---
# Rivers
# ---

river-spread-scale: 1
# Controls how far / close apart rivers generally are, larger scale = further apart
# rivers, smaller scale = closer packed together rivers.
# Default: 1

river-min-width: 13
# Controls in blocks the minimum width of rivers.
# Default: 13

river-max-width: 30
# Controls in blocks the maximum width of rivers.
