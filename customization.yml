# This file provides various general options for configuring this config pack.
# The options are specific to this config pack (and are not general to Terra as a whole!)
#
# Other config files reference reference these options via the metaconfiguration system,
# See http://terra.polydev.org/config/development/meta-configuration.html for further
# explanation of how this works.

global-scale: 1
# Modifies the scale of all biome distribution, you can use this parameter 
# to if you want just about every biome to be larger or smaller.
# By doubling the scale, you double the length & width of everything,
# e.g. if you have a biome that is 300 blocks wide with a scale of 1, and
# increase that scale to 2, that biome will generate 600 blocks wide.
# This value only applies to horizontal scale, NOT vertical scale.
# Default: 1

# ---
# Terrain
# ---

# Options that are focused on controlling terrain shaping.
# All the terrain options below are primarily used by biome terrain parameters
# implemented by abstract biome configs found in the biomes/abstract/terrain directory.

terrain-base-y-level: 65
# The base terrain y level. Generally the lowest y level for terrain, this is just a
# guide and some configs will lower terrain below this point (however not by much).
# Default: 65

terrain-height: 230
# Number of blocks above the base terrain level that terrain can go do, similarly to
# terrain-base-y-level this number is also a guide and some configs will produce terrain
# above this number (however not by much). Note that the sum of terrain-height and 
# terrain-base-y-level should no exceed the world height, otherwise you may see terrain
# clipping.
# Default: 230

terrain-ocean-base-y-level: 60
# The base ocean terrain y level, generally the highest level for terrain for ocean biomes.
# Default 60

terrain-ocean-depth: 100
# The number of blocks below terain-ocean-base-y-level that ocean terrain will go. Note
# that this number subtracted from terrain-ocean-base-y-level should not be lower than
# the lower bound of the world height range, otherwise you might end up with void holes in
# the world.
# Default: 100

# ---
# Continental
# ---

# Options that affects the 'continental value', a random number calculated for each xz position
# that describes if the position is land / coastal / ocean. A continental value of
# 1 means 100% inland, 0 means the coast, and -1 means 100% ocean.
# These options are primarily used in the math/samplers/continents.yml config file.

continental-offset: 0.15
# Controls the land / ocean ratio.
# - A value of 0 results in equal land and ocean
# - A value of 1 results in 100% land
# - A value of -1 results in 100% ocean
# - Any number in between these values can be used for controlling the
#   exact ratio you want.
#
# Dividing your desired land percentage by 50 then subtracting 1 will give
# you the equivalent continental-offset, i.e. land% / 50 - 1 = offset
#
# Default: 0.15

continental-spread: 1
# Controls how much variation there is in the continental value from
# the continental-offset.
#
# The range of the continental value is equal to:
#   [continental-offset - continental-spread, continental-offset + continental-spread]
#
# For example, with offset of 0 and spread of 1, the continental value would vary
# between -1 and 1.
#
# Default: 1

continental-scale: 2
# Controls the scale of land / coastal / oceanic distribution. Increasing
# this produces larger landmasses and larger oceans, and vice-versa when
# decreasing it. This does not control the ratio of land / ocean, for that
# you should change continental-offset instead.
# Default: 2

continental-coast-width: 15
# Determines the width of costal biomes in blocks.
# Default: 15

continental-coast-threshold: 0.05
# Determines how far from a continental value of 0 is considered for calculating 
# areas as coastal or not. This is more of a technical performance value and should only
# need to be increased in small increments experimentally if you are trying to increase
# continental-coast-width and or decrease continental-scale and do not see coastal biomes
# as wide as you are expecting.
#
# Increasing this value beyond what is needed to encompass the full potential coastal area
# will not affect generation, however may incur small performance penalties.
#
# Default: 0.05

# ---
# Elevation
# ---

# Options that control the elevation / height map.
# An elevation value of 0 corresponds to the lowest elevation, while a value of 1
# correspons to the highest elevation.
# These options are primarily used in the math/samplers/elevation.yml config file.

elevation-scale: 1.05
# Controls the scale of the elevation noise map. A larger scale results in larger distances
# between aspects like mountain ranges and flat areas. If you want more gradual changes in
# elevation, you can increase this. Conversely, if you want more sudden changes in elevation,
# you can decrease this.
# Note - This does not affect how tall the terrain is in individual biomes, for that you
#        can check out the parameters under the 'Terrain' section.
# Default: 1

elevation-multiplier: 1
# Multiplier on the elevation value.
# If set to 0, elevation will be the value set by 'elevation-offset' defined below
# Default: 1

elevation-offset: 0
# Adds / subtracts from the raw elevation value.
# Default: 0

elevation-highlands-threshold: 0.4
# Areas with an elevation value greater than this will be considered highlands in
# biome distribution.
# Default: 0.4

elevation-lowlands-threshold: 0.15
# Areas with an elevation value lower than this will be considered lowlands in
# biome distribution.
# Default: 0.1

elevation-factor-continental: 1
# Determines if terrain height will be reduced closer to coasts. This
# is used to prevent mountains forming right up against the ocean, and
# gradually smooths the terrain into coasts. The continental values at which
# terrain goes from 100% to flat can be customized with the options below.
# 1 = true, 0 = false
# Default: 1

elevation-continental-full-height-threshold: 0.35
# The continental value at which terrain height is 100%, only applicable if
# the terrain-factor-continental option is enabled
# Default: 0.35

elevation-continental-flat-threshold: -0.3
# The continental value at which terrain height will be flat, only applicable if
# the terrain-factor-continental option is enabled
# Default: -0.3

elevation-factor-rivers: 1
# Determines if terrain will gradually reduce closer to rivers.
# 1 = true, 0 = false
# Default: 1

elevation-factor-spawn-island: 1
# Determines if spawn island noise affects terrain, 1 = true, 0 = false
# Default: 1

elevation-spawn-island-scale: 0.2
# Scales elevation within the spawn island. E.g 0.3 means elevation is set to 30%
# within the spawn island.
# Default: 0.2

elevation-fuzz: 0.25
# Adds a slight bit of fuzziness to elevation, roughening terrain block countours
# and steep hills that look overly smooth. Small 1 block divots tend to be produced
# by this fuzzing. Recommended to be a small number between 0 and 0.5.
# Setting to 0 removes any fuzzing.
# Default: 0.25

# Default: 0.95

# ---
# Temperature
# ---

temperature-scale: 1.01
# Controls the scale of temperature zones. Most biomes are placed according to
# a temperature map so hot biomes can't generate next to cold biomes, as well as
# allowing for biomes of similar temperatures to generate together. Increasing this
# will increase the distance between temperature changes, which results in things like
# hot and cold biomes generating further apart - and vice versa when decreasing it.

# climate, while increasing it will result in larger climate variations.
# Default: 1.5

# ---
# Caves
# ---

cave-biome-scale: 1

# Elevation above this threshold is set to generate as shallow ocean. Lower number = larger area of shallow ocean
# and vice versa.
# Default: -0.1

ocean-deep-threshold: -0.8

# and vice versa.
# Default: -0.8

# ---
