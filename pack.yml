# Biome distribution
# ---
# Several preset biome providers are available to choose from below.
# Choosing which one is in use is as simple as commenting the enabled one
# (by adding a # at the start) and uncommenting the one you wish to use.

# If you want to tweak biome distribution, there are some basic
# parameters that can be found in the meta.yml config file.

# You can also further configure the behaviour of each preset in the
# referenced file(s) below.

# Default biome distribution
biomes: $biome-providers/presets/default.yml:biomes

# Single biome - to change the single biome to use, check the configuration file.
#biomes: $biome-providers/presets/single.yml:biomes



# ---
# Population stages
# ---
# Here are the population stages that occur after the initial terrain
# within a chunk is generated. Stages are ordered from top to bottom
# chronologically, where the top stage is executed first.

# If you wish to disable a generation stage, you can simply comment
# it out by prepending it with #, this is useful if you want
# something like a world without ores.

stages:
  # Used to generate lava at the bottom of the world.
  # NOTE - This key must only be defined in biomes/abstract/base.yml

    type: FEATURE
  
  # Misc features that are treated as small modifications to the initial chunk generation.
  - id: preprocessors
    type: FEATURE
  
  # Used for things like boulders and features that act like a part of the terrain.

  # Adds slab versions of some blocks to make terrain look smoother.
  - id: slabs

  # Self-explanatory - used to generate ores.
  # NOTE - Individual biomes should extend from configs in biomes/abstract/features/ores
  #        rather than overwriting this key themselves.
  - id: ores
    type: FEATURE
  
  # Adds things like dirt, andesite and gravel patches.
  # NOTE - Individual biomes should extend from configs in biomes/abstract/features/deposits

  # Used for biome specific river variant features.
  # NOTE - Individual biomes should extend from configs in biomes/abstract/features/river
  #        rather than overwriting this key themselves.
  - id: river-decoration
    type: FEATURE
  
  # Used for larger things that generate on the surface like trees, some other features are
  # also treated as trees like ice spikes.
  - id: trees
    type: FEATURE
    
  # Used for small features placed underwater like sea-grass.
  - id: underwater-flora
    type: FEATURE
