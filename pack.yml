# Biome distribution
# ---
# Several preset biome providers are available to choose from below.
# Choosing which one is in use is as simple as commenting the enabled one
# (by adding a # at the start) and uncommenting the one you wish to use.

# If you want to tweak biome distribution, there are some basic
# parameters that can be found in the meta.yml config file.

# You can also further configure the behaviour of each preset in the
# referenced file(s) below.

# Default biome distribution

# Single biome - to change the single biome to use, check the configuration file.

# Population stages
# ---
# Here are the population stages that occur after the initial terrain
# within a chunk is generated. Stages are ordered from top to bottom
# chronologically, where the top stage is executed first.

# If you wish to disable a generation stage, you can simply comment
# it out by prepending it with #, this is useful if you want
# something like a world without ores.

stages:
  - id: global-preprocessors # Used to generate lava at the bottom of the world
    type: FEATURE

  - id: preprocessors # Misc features that are treated as small modifications
    type: FEATURE     # to the initial chunk generation.

  - id: landforms # Used for things like boulders and features that act
    type: FEATURE # like a part of the terrain.

  - id: slabs # Adds slab versions of some blocks to make terrain look smoother
    type: FEATURE

  - id: ores # Self-explanatory - used to generate ores
    type: FEATURE

  - id: deposits # Adds things like dirt, andesite and gravel patches
    type: FEATURE

  - id: river-decoration # Used for biome specific river variant features
    type: FEATURE

  - id: underwater-flora # Used for small features placed underwater like sea-grass
    type: FEATURE

  - id: flora # Used for small features placed on the surface like tall grass and vines
    type: FEATURE

  - id: trees # Used for larger things that generate on the surface like trees, some other
    type: FEATURE # features are also treated as trees like ice spikes.

  - id: postprocessors # Used to generate something that must come after all other features, such as snow on trees
