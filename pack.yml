# Biome distribution
# ---
# Several preset biome providers are available to choose from below.

# To pick a different preset you can uncomment the line starting with 'biomes:'
# under the preset name, and comment the old preset that was previously set.
# (Not commenting the old one will result in an error!)

# Default biome distribution
biomes: $biome-distribution/presets/default.yml:biomes

# Single biome - Generates a single biome, as well as other complementary biomes such as cave and river biomes.
#                It is recommended to disable 'terrain-factor-continental' in customization.yml when using this preset.
#biomes: $biome-distribution/presets/single.yml:biomes
preset-single-biome: TEMPERATE_GRASSLAND

# Single debug - Used for debugging a singular biome, should not be used for regular world generation
#biomes: $biome-distribution/presets/single_debug.yml:biomes
preset-single-debug-biome: TEMPERATE_GRASSLAND

# Population stages
# ---
# Here are the population stages that occur after the initial terrain
# within a chunk is generated. Stages are ordered from top to bottom
# chronologically, where the top stage is executed first.

# If you wish to disable a generation stage, you can simply comment
# it out by prepending it with #, this is useful if you want
# something like a world without ores.

  # Used to generate lava at the bottom of the world.
