# averageCountPerChunk
#  : On average many deposits appear within a single chunk / 16x16 grid of columns.
#
# salt
#  : Adjusts the random seed for the placement of each deposit.
#
#  Every deposit should have a unique salt value, such that they all have unique distributions.
#
# range
#  : Specifies the height range of deposits on the Y axis.
#

# To adjust the size of individual deposits, refer to the relevant
# configs found in the /structures/deposits/ directory.

# ---
# Ore Veins
# ---
# The height ranges and count per chunk are defined to roughly match that of vanilla 1.18.

# Ores prefixed with '-uniform' are uniformly distributed (Equal chance of generating across the specified Y range), otherwise
# ores are normally distributed such that they are more common closer to the halfway point between the min and max.

# For math nerds: Standard deviation is calculated via meta configuration based on min & max such that the majority (~99.7%)
# of random heights calculated fit within said min & max. (This is calculated by simply dividing the distance between min and max by 6.)
# This behaviour is configured within each individual ore FEATURE config.
