# Biomes

This directory contains all biome configs, which defines all the biomes
contained within this pack. It is organized into 4 subdirectories:

# Abstract

Contains all abstract biome configs, which provide parameters that are shared
between biomes. You can find a more in-depth explanation in the README file
contained inside this directory.

# Aquatic

Contains all aquatic biome configs, which are further organized into deep ocean,
ocean, and river. Within these categories, there are a couple more layers of
organization based on the climates the biomes fit into.

# Land

Contains all land biome configs. Land biome configs are also grouped similarly
to aquatic biome config.

# Other

Contains all other biome configs that do not fit into the previous categories.
This includes things like mushroom island biomes, and volcanic biomes.

# `colors.yml`

The `colors.yml` file assigns a unique color for each biome, for use in biome
distribution (for placement via image providers and visualization in dev tools).
This file also serves as a good list of all biomes in one place if you want to
see what biomes exist without sifting through the directory hierarchy.
