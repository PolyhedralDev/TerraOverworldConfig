# Tags are used by biomes to determine the kind of river to use, except for biomes with
# their own specific river biome. These tags are formatted by the type of river, and optionally
# the type of river wetlands surrounding the river, e.g USE_FROZEN_RIVER_FROZEN_MARSH would mean
# the biome will use a frozen river with frozen marshes surrounding it.
